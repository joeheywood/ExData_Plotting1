Guide to this project==============I have carried out this project in the way that I like to do things. I have separated all of the plot commands into separate R files, as suggested. I have also included a separate file for quickly extracting the data we need using the `data.table` package.To run the analysis, run the following commands```source('save_data_run.R')tidy_save() # saves all the data to a compressed RDS filerunAnalysis() # runs the functions for each plot```The output that I got, in terms of graphs is as follows:Plot 1------Simple enough. Just a histogram, with bin set to 0.5 (which I think it does automatically anyway!![The first plot we had to do!](plot1.png) Plot 2------Simple enough. Just a histogram, with bin set to 0.5 (which I think it does automatically anyway!![The first plot we had to do!](plot2.png) Plot 3------Simple enough. Just a histogram, with bin set to 0.5 (which I think it does automatically anyway!![The first plot we had to do!](plot3.png)
